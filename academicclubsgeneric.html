									<h3>Academic Decathlon Club</h3>							
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="acadeca.jpg" alt="" /></span>Do you like learning? Do you want to learn more efficiently and intelligently? Join the Academic Decathlon club where members train for, in the most literal sense, an academic decathlon that consists of 10 different areas: math, science, literature, economics, social science, music, art history, interview, speech, and the Super Quiz. Whether you are a top student or an academically low-performing student, Academic Decathlon levels the playing field by putting students in three different partitions based on unweighted GPA. Learn more about AcaDeca on <a href="www.millsacadeca.org">www.millsacadeca.org</a>.  Meet Wednesdays at lunch in room 131.  <br><strong>Presidents --- Michael Chang and Annie Lu</strong></p>

									<h3>California Scholarship Federation (CSF)</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="csf.jpg" alt="" /></span>CSF is a nationally recognized Honor Society that promotes academic excellence and public service in Millbrae. CSF members annually participate in fun and rewarding activities that give back to the community, such as Toys for Tots and blood drives. Members who participate for a minimum of four semesters will be acknowledged at graduation and on their transcript.  Meet every other Thursday at lunch in room 136.  <br><strong>President --- Fiona Dale-Huang</strong></p>

									<h3>Debate Team</h3>
									<p>The Mills Debate Team offers the unique experience of learning and practicing formal debate. We attend competitions and hold weekly debates in order to prepare our members for their future competitions and day to day arguments. In our last competition, the Georgiana Hayes competition, we had pairs place both 5th and 7th out of the 19 pairs, along with two members placing in the top ten speakers. If anyone is looking for a fun and rewarding club that will teach them about argumentative speaking, or even a club that will help them with public speaking, without a doubt, the Mills Debate Team is the club for you. Meetings are on Wednesday at lunch in Room 132. <br><strong>President --- Stephanie Wong</strong></p>
 
 
									<h3>G.A.T.E</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="gate.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Gifted and Talented Education Club (GATE) strives to create an educationally enriching and safe environment where students can share and discover their individual talents. We participate in exciting field trips, fun activities, and thoughtful discussions. Our past activities include the annual Dicken's Faire, the San Francisco Puzzle Room, and a tour of Google Headquarters. Join us for a year of fun! Meet Mondays at lunch in room 122. <br><strong>Presidents --- Matthew Corpus and Fiona Dale-Huang</strong></p>

									<h3>TED-Ed Club</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="teded.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Mills High School TED-Ed club is a platform for students to freely hold discussions about passionate topics. As a sector of the TED-Ed program, this club promotes the use of public speaking and the spread of different ideas among the Mills High School community. Meetings are on Wednesday at lunch in Room 136. <br><strong>President --- Michelle Chan</strong></p>
