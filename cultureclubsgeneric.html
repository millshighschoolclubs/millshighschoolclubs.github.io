									<h3>Dragon Team</h3>
									<p>The Mills High School Dragon Team is performing for its 21st year as a performance art and a cultural experience.

Their combined efforts carry on the tradition and represents their school through a cultural performance.During school, we meet at room 132 (Mr. Phillips) only when necessary or important. Usually, we have two of these meetings during lunch. Outside of school days, we have a practice every week for 5-7 weeks. <br><strong>Presidents --- Seth Tantuico, Pauline Yang, Timothy Leung, Jadelyn Eagens</strong></p>

							

									<h3>Filipino American Alliance (FAA)</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="tinikling.png" alt="" /></span>FAA is a cultural club where any student at Mills, regardless of race, can learn about Filipino traditions and the language Tagalog. We participate in many school events such as food fairs, Mills Mania, and perform the dance Tinikling for the International Assembly. For Tinikling, we practice after school in order to imitate the gracefulness and speed of birds when they are maneuvering through trees, stems, branches and bamboo poles. Also, potlucks allow our family to get together and relieve us from some stress by having good food, good company and fun.  Meetings are held every other Thursday during lunch in Mr. Lira's room. <br><strong>Presidents --- Michaela Serna + Alexa Julaton</strong></p>

We meet in room 154 every Friday. <br><strong>President --- Alec Guiulfo</strong><br></p>
