									<h3>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS CLUB:</h3>

									<h3>DRAMA CLUB</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="pusheen.jpg" alt="" /></span>Drama Club was created to bring people who love theatre together. Our main project is the annual Drama Club Showcase at the end of the year, which is completely student-run. Throughout the year, we also arrange field trips to see plays or musicals outside of school, as well as creating games and activities within each club meeting. Our goal is to create a space for the theatre kids of Mills to feel at home. Meet Mondays at lunch in room 1er and Wednesdays after school in the auditorium (every other week).<br><strong>Presidents --- Chacha Tahng and Henry Gerharz</strong></p>

There, you can practice your speaking and negotiating skills as well as your ability to craft comprehensive, effective resolutions to real-world issues given to you ahead of time. Anyone is welcome to be a member of Mills MUN! Meet Fridays at lunch in room 132.<br><strong>Presidents --- Michael Chang and Annie Lu</strong> </p>

									<h3>PHILOSOPHY CLUB</h3>

Every Thursday we convene to talk about possible fundraisers for the club, and to encourage artistic freedom and individuality.  We encourage all students to contribute to our magazine, regardless of whether or not they are club members because, after all, we believe that everybody has their own unique vision that they're just dying to share with the world.
